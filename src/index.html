          <p>
            Here, you can submit anonymous feedback about me to me, Mara Fr√∂hlich.
          </p>
          <p>
            Have something you'd rather not say to my face?
            Did I make a mistake and you want to criticize it?
            Got a compliment for me, but it's never the right time to bring it up?
          </p>
          <p>
            Put it here, press "Send", and it'll end up as an email sent to mara.froehlich@proton.me.
          </p>

          <summary>Why though?</summary>
          <p>
            Self Improvement is a skill that relies both on self awareness (what you notice about yourself)
            and feedback from others (what others notice about you).
          </p>
          <p>
            Composing a sentence in your head takes time. It's not a lot of time, but enough to
            think about whether the information is truly beneficial to your communication partner,
            whether the situation is right, and how the sentence will affect your social & cultural 
            dynamic (i.e. your relationship with all those who are listening to you right now).
          </p>
          <p>
            It is good that some things end up unsaid. But not always. Not for everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            This feedback site allows me to gather some of the unsaid critiques, compliments,
            small notes, pent-up anger, and other things that fall through the cracks. It is anonymous, so that
            you don't have to worry about consequences, social or otherwise. It is online, because
            unlike me, this webpage is available 24 hours a day. It is easier than
            an anonymous email or text, because by the time you've set up an account for one, you've
            almost always thought "Is it worth it?", and the answer is almost always no.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only true barrier that remains is composing your sentences here, and sending them.
            I can't really make it easier than that.
